Step 1: Start with content. As a starting point, we’ll write up raw text content and see what browsers do with it.

Step 2: Give the document structure. You’ll learn about HTML element syntax and the elements that give a document its structure.

Step 3: Identify text elements. You’ll describe the content using the appropriate text elements and learn about the proper way to use HTML.

Step 4: Add an image. By adding an image to the page, you’ll learn about attributes and empty elements.

Step 5: Change the page appearance with a style sheet. This exercise gives you a taste of formatting content with Cascading Style Sheets.
